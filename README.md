# Final-Project-Tableau


## Project/Goals
The objective of this project was to use Tableau's capabilities to analyze and illustrate the FIFA 2018 dataset in order to provide insightful information on player performances and valuations. Our objectives were to identify significant patterns in player attributes, determine the correlation between these and player market prices, and provide football scouts and managers with useful insights.
## Process
Data Acquisition: The FIFA 2018 dataset was obtained, containing detailed attributes for over 17,000 players.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial EDA was performed to understand the data's structure and identify potential insights.
Formulation of Questions: Questions were formulated inorder to discover the factors influencing player valuations, the correlation
between player attributes
Visualization Development: A series of Tableau visualizations were created to address the questions formulated and explore different facets of the data, from player valuation to global talent distribution.
Dashboard Assembly: An interactive dashboard was constructed, synthesizing individual visualizations into a cohesive analytical tool.

## Results
Option 2 was chosen for this project. The FIFA 2018 dataset was selected due to my passion towards football and relevance to current football analytics. The visualizations created include:
     A scatter plot correlating player ratings with market values.
     A bar chart ranking football clubs by their average player ratings.
     A world map highlighting the geographical distribution of player talent.
     A line chart focusing on attributes of elite players, 
     A packed bubble showing undervalued high-potential players
     A line chart forecasting or predicting age-based performance and aged-based value.

The primary data question was: "How do player attributes and market values correlate, and what does this reveal about talent distribution across clubs and countries?" The analysis followed the project prompts meticulously, leading to the creation of a dashboard that not only answers this question but also offers an interactive platform for further exploration.
## Challenges 
Throughout this project, challenges included managing large volumes of data, optimizing the dashboard for performance, and selecting the most impactful visualizations to convey complex insights clearly. Addressing these challenges required a combination of technical proficiency, creative data storytelling, and iterative design.

## Future Goals
Using Additional Data resources to observe trends over time.
Social Sentiment Analysis to analyze social media sentiment to give us insights into the public perception of players.
Integrate player injury and health status which is by including data on player injuries and overall health, we can provide a more holistic view of a player's value and risk, offering a crucial tool for club management decisions.
